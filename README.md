Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices]  
Real case: The dataset contains historical car auction sales prices, scraped from outside internet sources. The dataset was collected in 2015, and will not be updated.

## Summary  

**Background** (Fake scenario): This is an e-commerce company that specializes in selling used cars. During the sales period, the company experienced quite extreme instability in sales trends. The main cause is that the prices set by sellers on the platform are not suitable for customers, thus affecting purchasing interest.   
**Objectives**: Increase car sales transactions by providing appropriate price recommendations for sellers   
**Business Metrics**   
a. Click-Through Rate (CTR)  => Click-through rate is **the ratio of clicks** on a specific link (ML model after deployment) to see how this model can help the seller  
b. Price To Market => Price adjustments for different markets. Measuring PTM allows sellers to find opportunities to gain maximum profit by **measuring the value** (using model machine learning) of their vehicle.  
c. Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)  => GMV is considered an important metric to be able to measure company growth by calculating the growth of total transactions on our platform, as in the problems previously explained.
